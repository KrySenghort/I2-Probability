        "However, as you might notice rolling a five on the first and second, would be the same as rolling it on the second and first. We have too many variations. We need to divide our result by how many of these will be the same. This depends on how many times we wanted a success. In the example it was twice a five, so 2. Now I can pick again out of 2 for my first one, and then only one option left for the second. So in general $k!$. If we were interested in rolling three times a five, then $k=3$ and we'll get for each variation $k!$ times.\n",
